## Tech Stack

- ReactJS + Typescript
- npm

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Project Requirement

Write a responsive “Contacts” application that allows the user to browse their contacts:

- Make use of https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ (/users are the contacts)
- Use either VueJS, Angular or React
- Make it visually appealing
- No need to implement Create/Update/Delete
- Provide instructions on how to run the code

## Features Implemented:

- **List Contacts**: All contacts are listed on the main page, accessible via the route /.
- **Contact Details**: Clicking on each row in the contacts table will show detailed information about the selected contact.
- **Create Contact**: Even though it was not a part of the initial requirements, a feature to create new contacts has been added. You can access this feature at the route /register.
- **Edit Contact**: This platform allows users to edit existing contact information.
- **Delete Contact**: Each row in the contact table includes a trash icon on the most right column, allowing users to delete contacts.

* As this uses mock data, executing these operations won't reflect changes on the actual server.
